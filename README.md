# LaST: Large-Scale Spatio-Temporal Person Re-identification

This repository contains the source code for loading the **LaST** dataset and evaluating its generalization. 
The paper is available at: [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.15076.pdf)] 

## Details
**LaST** is a large-scale dataset with more than **228k** pedestrian images. It is used to study the scenario that pedestrians have a large activity scope and time span. Although collected from movies, we have carefully selected suitable frames and labeled them.

* **Train**: **5000** identities and **71,248** images.
