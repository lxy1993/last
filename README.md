This repository contains the source code for loading the **LaST** dataset and evaluating its generalization. 

## Details
**LaST** is a large-scale dataset with more than **228k** pedestrian images. It is used to study the scenario that pedestrians have a large activity scope and time span. Although collected from movies, we have selected suitable frames and labeled them as carefully as possible.

* **Train**: **5000** identities and **71,248** images.
* **Val**:   **56** identities and **21,379** images.
* **Test**:  **5806** identities and **135,529** images.

**note**: The clothes of pedestrians in training set were labeled. You can download LaST from this link: [LaST]() with passward:.
